## 🌐 Vision

Astryx is founded on the belief that AI agents are the next evolution of smart contracts—trustworthy, transparent, and accountable. In our ecosystem, every agent’s logic is verifiable, all actions are auditable, and users stay in control.

> “AI agents are not just reactive, they’re proactive. They make decisions, adapt to data, and self-optimize—always with the user’s interests and transparency in mind.”

---

## 🤝 Trust & Transparency

At Astryx, trust is not a marketing slogan—it’s a technical guarantee:

- **Open Source, Always:** Every line of Astryx’s code is publicly auditable, MIT-licensed, and open for review.
- **Verifiable Agent Code:** Agent logic is stored on tamper-proof networks (IPFS/Arweave), ensuring code can’t be swapped or obfuscated after deployment.
- **Immutable Audit Trail:** All agent actions and decisions are recorded on-chain for independent verification and future-proof accountability.
- **User Consent:** Agents only execute actions and access data with explicit user permission—no silent data harvesting or hidden behaviors.
- **Cryptographic Security:** All agent interactions are signed and verified using industry-standard cryptography and on-chain signatures.
- **Privacy by Design:** Sensitive data is never shared or logged without clear user opt-in; support for end-to-end encrypted agent communication is in the roadmap.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (coming soon):** Agents will be able to prove compliance and correctness without exposing sensitive data.
- **Transparent Governance:** Roadmaps, proposals, and major decisions are public and community-driven, with plans for DAO-based governance.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- **Unified AI Agent Framework:** Build, register, and manage AI agents with a simple, auditable API.
- **On-Chain Interoperability:** Integrate with Solana and other chains for trustless, decentralized execution.
- **OpenAI & Custom Model Support:** Use ChatGPT or your own LLMs.
- **Real-Time, Adaptive Agents:** Agents learn, adapt, and improve from live data—while logs and updates remain verifiable.
- **Multi-Language SDKs:** Available in TypeScript, Python, and Rust.
- **Agent Marketplace:** Browse, test, and fork public agents, all with clear provenance and code history.
- **Webhooks & Plugins:** Securely connect to off-chain apps—agents never act outside user-defined permissions.
- **Comprehensive Monitoring:** Track agent actions, logs, and performance in a transparent dashboard.
- **Agent Studio (coming soon):** Visual, low-code builder with secure simulation environments.
- **Security & Compliance:** Best-practice authentication, rate limiting, and schema validation everywhere.

## 🧠 Example: Creating a Trustworthy AI Agent

```ts
// src/agents/price_monitor.ts
import { createAgent } from 'astryx-sdk';

createAgent({
  id: 'agent_price_watch',
  model: 'gpt-4',
  trigger: 'priceDrop',
  threshold: 10,
  action: async (context) => {
    // All actions are logged and user-approved before alerts are sent
    await context.sendAlert(`Price dropped by 10%! Current: ${context.price}`);
  }
});
```

## 🧰 Developer Toolkit

- **SDKs:** `astryx-sdk` (JS/TS), `astryx-py` (Python), `astryx-rs` (Rust)
- **CLI:** `npx astryx init` — Bootstrap projects in seconds
- **Templates:** Auditable agent blueprints
- **Agent Studio UI:** Visual builder (coming soon)
- **Simulation Tools:** Test agents with dry-runs in an auditable sandbox
- **Type Definitions:** Schema validation for all agent inputs/outputs

---

## 🌍 Why Solana?

- **High Throughput:** Handles thousands of transactions per second for scalable agent operations.
- **Low Fees:** Microtransactions and frequent updates are affordable and accessible.
- **Immutable State:** On-chain data and signatures provide tamper-proof history.
- **Vibrant Ecosystem:** Large community, robust tools, and transparent open-source standards.
- **Compression:** Efficient, low-cost agent storage with state compression.

---

## 🔐 Security & Trust

- **Verifiable Storage:** Agent code and configs stored on IPFS/Arweave—immutable and always auditable.
- **On-chain Signatures:** All external agent actions must be cryptographically validated.
- **ZK Proofs:** Zero-knowledge agent execution (coming soon) for privacy and compliance.
- **OAuth2/JWT:** Industry-standard authentication and authorization.
- **User-Centric Permissions:** Agents cannot access or act on data without explicit user approval.
- **Rate Limiting:** Protects against abuse while logs remain publicly auditable.
- **Responsible Disclosure:** Security vulnerabilities can be reported via [security@astryx.org](mailto:security@astryx.org).
